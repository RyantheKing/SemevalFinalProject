# SemEval 2026 Task 10  starter pack
Scripts to facilitate participation in the 2026 Semeval Task 10: PsyCoMark -- Psycholinguistic Conspiracy Marker Extraction and Detection

--------
## Download and rehydrate plain text data
1. `git clone https://github.com/hide-ous/semeval26_starter_pack.git`
2. `cd semeval26_starter_pack`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. place `train_redacted.jsonl` in the folder (available on [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15114171))
5. run `python rehydrate_data.py` to generate `train_rehydrated.jsonl` containing plain texts
6. `submission_example.py` provides you with the boilerplate script to prepare a submission in the right format (by default, no model is used: the submission attributes no markers and "No" conspiracy to each comment)

## Conspiracy detection baseline
1. run `train_binary.py` (~6 minutes on gpu) 
2. run `infer_binary.py`
3. zip the submission `submission.jsonl` --> `submission.zip`
4. go to the [detection task on codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/10749/)
   1. go to the "my submissions" tab 
   2. upload the zip file
   3. wait a few minutes for evaluation (tip: if the page does not reload, switch back and forth to the test phase)
   4. add the result to the leaderboard and make it public!
   5. you should score ~ 0.76 weighted F1 on the dev set

## Changes
Ollama must be installed and running locally, with `qwen3-embedding` model loaded in memory.
Running train_binary.py the first time will generate the embeddings using the embedding model and save them to embeddings.npy. \\
Future trainings will be much faster since they won't have to recalculate the embeddings. \\
Running infer_binary.py will create a submissions.jsonl as mentioned above. \\
Files that didn't undergo modification and aren't necessary to the binary classifier training and inference pipeline like the `one_span` files have been removed to avoid confusion. \\
For more instructions on experimentation and explanation of the code, please refer to the README.md file in the root directory of this repository.
